        <p>C# is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables
            developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C
            family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers. This tour
            provides an overview of the major components of the language in C# 8 and earlier. If you want to explore the
            language through interactive examples, try the </p>
        <p>C# emphasizes versioning to ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner.
            Aspects of C#'s design that were directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate
            <code>virtual</code> and <code>override</code> modifiers, the rules for method overload resolution, and
            support for
            explicit interface
            member declarations.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language. C# provides language constructs to
                directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software
                components. </li>
            <li>Several C# features help create robust and durable applications. Garbage collection automatically
                reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects.</li>

    <section class="main-section" id=".NET">
        <header>.NET</header>
        <p>C# programs run on .NET, a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a set of
            class libraries. The CLR is the implementation by Microsoft of the common language infrastructure (CLI), an
            international standard. The CLI is the basis for creating execution and development environments in which
            languages and libraries work together seamlessly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Source code written in C# is compiled into an intermediate language (IL) that conforms to the CLI
                specification.</li>
            <li>Code that's executed by the CLR is sometimes referred to as "managed code." "Unmanaged code," is
                compiled into native machine language that targets a specific platform.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
        <header>Hello World</header>
        <p>The "Hello, World" program is traditionally used to introduce a programming language. Here it is in C#:</p>
        <p><code>using System;<br>

            class Hello<br>
            {<br>
                static void Main()<br>
                {<br>
                    Console.WriteLine("Hello, World");<br>
                }<br>
            }</code></p>
        <p>The output of the program is produced by the <code>WriteLine</code> method of the <code>Console</code> class
            in
            the <code>System</code> namespace.
            This class is provided by the standard class libraries, which, by default, are automatically referenced by
            the compiler.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in
            C# has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory the range of values
            that can be stored within that memory and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Intergal</b>-byte,int,short,long,char</li>
            <li><b>Floating</b>-float,double</li>
            <li><b>Decimal</b>-decimal</li>
            <li><b>Boolean</b>-true,false</li>
            <li><b>Nullable</b>-nullable</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <p>Syntax for variable definition in C# is −</p>
        <p><code>&#60;datat_type&#62; &#60;variable_name&#62;</code></p>
        <p>Here, data_type must be a valid C# data type , and variable_name may consist of one or more identifier names
            separated by commas.</p>
        <ul>Examples
            <li>int i, j, k;</li>
            <li>float price;</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>
        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available
            to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a
            local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <p>Constants are immutable values which are known at compile time and do not change for the life of the program.
        </p>
        <p> Constants are declared with the const modifier. Only the C# built-in types may be
            declared as <code>const</code>. User-defined types, including classes, structs, and arrays, cannot be
            <code>const</code>.

    <section class="main-section" id="if-else">
        <header>if-else</header>
        <p>Use the if statement to specify a block of C# code to be executed if a condition is <code>True</code>.</p>
        <div><code>if (condition) <br>  
            { <br>
              // block of code to be executed if the condition is True <br>

            }</code></div>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="While_loop">
        <header>While loop</header>
        <p>The C# while loop continually executes a block of statements until a specified expression evaluates to false
            . The expression is evaluated each time the loop is encountered and the evaluation result is true, the loop
            body statements are executed.

        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>A function allows you to encapsulate a piece of code and call it from other parts of your code. You may very
            soon run into a situation where you need to repeat a piece of code, from multiple places, and this is where
            functions come in. </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Classes">
        <header>Classes</header>
        <p>In C#, the definition of a type—a class is like a blueprint that specifies what the type can do. An object is
            basically a block of memory that has been allocated and configured according to the blueprint. This article
            provides an overview of these blueprints and their features. </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Objects">
        <header>Objects</header>
        <p>A class or struct definition is like a blueprint that specifies what the type can do. An object is basically
            a block of memory that has been allocated and configured according to the blueprint. A program may create
            many objects of the same class. Objects are also called instances, and they can be stored in either a named
            variable or in an array or collection. Client code is the code that uses these variables to call the methods
            and access the public properties of the object. In an object-oriented language such as C#, a typical program
            consists of multiple objects interacting dynamically.
